**Input data:** We will collect data from GitHub repositories in Java language which used Apache Maven.

**Output data:** Output data will be a Dataset with the top APIs

## Findings of replication with subsections as follows:

**Process delta:** How does your process differ from what’s described in the thesis or implemented in its repo? (Why?)
**Output delta:** How does your output differ …? (What’s the significance of any differences observed?)


## Implementation of replication with subsections as follows:

**Hardware requirements:** (incl. OS) for running your process.
**Software requirements:** regarding frameworks, tools, etc. required for running your process.
**Validation:** Any sort of advice on how to check that the output of your process makes sense.
